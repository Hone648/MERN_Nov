  - Array / bar visualization: https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/algorithms/sorting/insertion-sort/visualize/
  - Stable sort, efficient for small data sets or mostly sorted data sets
  Time Complexity
    - Best:     O(n) linear when array is already sorted
    - Average:  O(n^2) quadratic
    - Worst:    O(n^2) quadratic when the array is reverse sorted
  Space: O(1) constant
  - this sort splits the array into two portions (conceptually, not literally)
  - the left portion will become sorted, the right portion (that hasn't been iterated over yet) is unsorted

  // swap steps:
  1. consider the first item as sorted
  2. move to the next item
  4. if item to left of current item is less than current, swap
  5. repeat step 4 until item to left is less than current item
  6. move to next item and repeat
